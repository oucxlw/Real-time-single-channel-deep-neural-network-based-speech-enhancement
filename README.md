# Real-time-single-channel-deep-neural-network-based-speech-enhancement

## Overview

This GitHub repository provides for Deep Neural Network based Single Microphone Speech Enhancement on edge devices (iPhone). The example app provided here is for hearing improvement studies. 
> **Abstract:** In this paper, we present a deep neural network architecture comprising of both convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) layers for real-time singlechannel speech enhancement (SE). The proposed neural network model focuses on enhancing the noisy speech magnitude spectrum on a frame-by-frame process. The developed model is implemented on the smartphone (edge device), to demonstrate the real-time usability of the proposed method. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) test results are used to compare the proposed algorithm to previously published conventional and deep learning-based SE methods. Subjective ratings show the performance improvement of the proposed model over the other baseline SE methods.
